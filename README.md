# aone_peerconnection
Server PeerConnection (for SFU / RTC Server)

This repository provides a server-oriented RTCPeerConnection implementation
based on the Google WebRTC Native source code.
It is designed for use in SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) servers,
custom RTC servers, or as the core of a server-side SDK,
where a lightweight, headless PeerConnection is required.

üìÇ Project Structure
RTCPeerConnection/
‚îú‚îÄ rtc_pc_src/   # Custom classes replacing or extending Google WebRTC classes
‚îú‚îÄ src/          # Google origin code with unused modules removed and light modifications
‚îî‚îÄ src_update/   # Additional updates / patches


Each directory follows the original Google WebRTC folder layout,
making it easier to track upstream changes and compare with the official source.

üîß Build Environment
Operating System: Ubuntu 21.04 or later (tested on Ubuntu 21/22)
Compiler:  Clang (standard Ubuntu packages)
Build System: GN + Ninja

Dependency: Google WebRTC Native Source (BSD-3-Clause)

Example Build Steps
# Generate GN build files
